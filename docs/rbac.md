#### User Token - Expiration

!!! TIP "user token"
    Expires after ~ 60 Minutes

#### Service Token - Expiration

!!! TIP "service token"
    Expires ~900 days

!!! TIP "Consideration on Cookies"
    Cookies are invalidated by the EasyAuthClient if the token inside the cookie has expired.

#### Revoking a Token
Once a token is created, it is valid until expiration or EasyAuthServer key rotation.


EasyAuthServer maintains a token registry of issued tokens, containing the underlying username, issue date, expiraiton_date & token_id.

EasyAuthServer updates all EasyAuthServer workers & connected EasyAuthClients when a token is added / revoked.

!!! TIP
    Tokens listed in the registry are seen as valid, and tokens which are revoked or do not exist in the registry, will return a 403.
